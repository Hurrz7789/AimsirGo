# AimsirGo 🌦️🚌 

> **A real-time, weather-resilient transit routing engine for Irish commuters.**  
> Developed by **Node4** as part of the Software Engineering module (Year 2, Computer Science & IT).

## 📌 Overview

In Ireland, transit navigation apps often optimize strictly for the shortest arrival time, frequently sending commuters on long, unsheltered walks during heavy rain or wind warnings.

**AimsirGo** solves this by factoring live weather conditions and public shelter data into route planning. The application dynamically adjusts travel routes and transfer recommendations to minimize rain exposure and avoid unshielded stops during severe weather conditions.
